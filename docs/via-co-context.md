## Positioning (short)

- **Philosophy:** Dedicated time for strategic decision-making; the real work of leadership (connecting vision/values to decisions and outcomes); win-win outcomes and "the greatest good."
- **Story:** Created to give leaders a path (the Hero's Journey) to overcome obstacles, improve performance, and bring about a "Golden Age" of leadership. Not just consulting — a practical framework plus tailored programs.
- **Approach:** Facilitators who give "the way" (VIA); the client is the protagonist. Hero's Journey framing; "advanced fundamentals" — complex made accessible.

## When to use this

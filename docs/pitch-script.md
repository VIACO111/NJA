## Greeting

Hey everyone! We've now heard a lot about bridging the gap between C-suite and HR, but what it really boils down to — the significance of better understanding and communication — is to align the decisions being made in a business.

## About us

People are ultimately at the core of any business. You might have in your company the best product, a really well thought-out hierarchy, and probably even some of the best software on the market to support your people. A lot of businesses have optimised everything leading up to people, but traditionally, this is where it stops.

We've been on a journey, researching and experimenting with what goes on in people's minds, especially as it relates to how they make decisions. What makes them choose A over B and C.

We bring to you real experience around how to improve the quality of the decisions you and everyone in your team makes. We offer programs for pairs, teams, and entire organisations to do this.

## About you

You are often in the middle between the organisation and the founders, as you see the core of the organisation, its people. Especially how they make their big decisions. For example while we were at Cisco we saw the CEO kept the head of HR and talent the closest, why? Because people are the beating heart of the company, they create the products, they build the solutions and they set the direction.

Often as time goes on and particularly with remote work you see that key conversations, difficult conversations build up. They can make or break a team. Sometimes it's a conversation about the business, its direction and positioning in the market. And sometimes it's an internal conversation about how to set up things in the team.

These can get blocked and you get to see the symptoms of these blockages first. Oh the founder won't listen. Or the founders saying oh the team are not good enough. A disagreement on how to build something or some client feedback that never gets listened to. These come up in your 1:1's with the team so you know them but sometimes you don't know what to do about these either. It requires a specific set-up, a way to have these conversations to unblock the team.

We've designed just that. We're experts in having the strategic conversations using techniques like flow-state that get everyone at ease and the egos out of the room. We'll design great offsites or do them right in your back-office. The point is that you need a way to get everyone together and make key decisions at certain times when the pressure is too high and before people quit.

Having an external facilitator is sometimes necessary for this because we bring objectivity, and sometimes you can run these kind of events yourself. For those of you interested in how to do this we've designed a special one of a kind training solution.

## The offer

You who are in this room, the P&C folks who work for some of the best businesses in Sydney, are the ones who can make the biggest difference to your leaders. You're in the unique position where you see (and people come to you) with the challenges that are in your organisation and you probably know how to fix most of it. But you need to bridge that gap to get your leaders to buy into the solution you're proposing.

So we're offering (on a first come, first served basis) a free training for you guys to understand how to improve the quality of the decisions in your organisation and help you get more buy-in from your C-suite.

We've got three spots available next quarter to run our team program if you're interested in taking the team out on an offsite, experiencing collective flow state, and doing the honest work of transforming your team's biggest challenges into lasting solutions.

If you're interested, you can scan the QR code on the left to sign up for the free training (limited to 10 spots) (we'll do 2 groups) and scan the QR code on the right to learn more about our team program.

We're super excited to connect with you all, please come chat to us after — we love to talk about anything related to performance mindset, psychology, and ____.

Thanks everyone!

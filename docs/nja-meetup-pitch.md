## Overview (community pitch)

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **#NJAMeetup** — a community for Sydney's TA and People folks who want to connect, swap ideas, and make work better (for real).

This is where ideas spark, real talk happens, and the future of work gets built. From hiring heroes to culture champions, if you're in the people game, you belong here.

We run **3 electric meetups every quarter** and cap it off with one massive annual event – **The NJA Summit** (mark your calendars for **Feb 2026** 🔥).

Expect fresh *uber practical* insights, candid convos, and loads of "aha" moments - all in a no-BS, high-energy space.

- 💬 Got something to say? Bring it.
- 🌱 Got something to learn? You're in the right place.
- 🚀 Ready to grow your network and your impact? Let's go.

**Join us! #NJAMeetup**

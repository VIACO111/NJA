      <p><strong>The Hidden Burden</strong></p>
      <p>P&C leaders are often privy to the many issues that teams face. Maybe the founders in a startup are misaligned, or maybe the overall team is struggling with market fit, or perhaps there's friction between the founder and the team.</p>
      
      <p><strong>The Difference Maker</strong></p>
      <p>A good talent leader knows how to call, capture, and orchestrate these strategic conversations for the unblocking and success of the company. A bad one loses people, time, and momentum in passivity.</p>
      
      <p><strong>The Opportunity</strong></p>
      <p>This is a massive problem that relates to how decisions are made in the company, something we are not normally trained to address. This is why we are creating this training: it is a unique opportunity for leaders—especially in the startup world or mid-size enterprises—to learn how to do it themselves and get access to two world-class experts for training.</p>

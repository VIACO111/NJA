    <Abstract
      title="Why this matters"
      content="<p><strong>Business moves fast.</strong> So fast that often the <strong>real conversations</strong> get ignored because they take time and energy to address.</p><p>These missing conversations block the team and result in stagnation. They can hinder progress and become missed opportunities, because that friction is actually <strong>where creativity is supposed to flourish</strong>.</p><p>As an HR leader, you need to be versed in when to call these meetings, how to orchestrate them, and how to partner with external organisations to facilitate them. That is exactly what this training is about.</p>"

      title="Executive infrastructure & strategic facilitation"
      bio="At VIA, we've conducted more than 50 workshops with various teams including Google, Cisco, and Atlassian. Jesus and Anastasiya have developed a systematic way to have these conversations by entering into flow state and leaving the ego behind. The result? Teams that are able to innovate, push through, and tackle blockages head-on, transforming them into opportunities."

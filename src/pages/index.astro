      title="Why this matters"
      content="<p>We've all heard about bridging the gap between C-suite and HR. What it really boils down to — the significance of better understanding and communication — is <strong>aligning the decisions being made in a business</strong>.</p><p>People are at the core of any business. You might have the best product, a well thought-out hierarchy, and great software to support your people. A lot of businesses have optimised everything leading up to people, but traditionally, this is where it stops.</p><p>We've been on a journey researching what goes on in people's minds, especially how they make decisions. We bring you real experience in <strong>improving the quality of the decisions</strong> you and everyone in your team makes — and we offer programs for pairs, teams, and entire organisations.</p>"

We've worked with leaders at Cisco, Atlassian, Canva, and others. We design offsites and run programs for pairs, teams, and entire organisations. For P&C folks who want to run these conversations themselves, we've designed a one-of-a-kind training solution."
